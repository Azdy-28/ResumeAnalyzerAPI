      "This evaluation assumes Azad is applying for a backend software developer role, given his projects and skills.  My expertise is in Software Development.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Strong Foundation:** Azad possesses a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals (Data Structures & Algorithms, OOP) demonstrated by his coursework and competitive programming achievements.\n",
      "* **Excellent Coding Skills:** His competitive programming rankings (Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef) are impressive, indicating a high level of proficiency in problem-solving and coding.  This is a major strength.\n",
      "* **Relevant Projects:** The Resume Analyzer and Contest Tracker APIs are well-aligned with backend development roles.  They showcase his ability to design, implement, and deploy RESTful APIs using FastAPI. The use of NLP in the Resume Analyzer is a plus.\n",
      "* **Technical Skills:** He has a good grasp of relevant technologies including Python, FastAPI, databases (PostgreSQL), and relevant libraries (NumPy, Pandas, though less critical for a backend role focused on APIs).\n",
      "* **GitHub Presence:** Publicly available repositories demonstrate his ability to work on projects independently and showcase his code.\n",
      "* **Extracurricular Activities:**  His involvement as an Executive Member in ACE NIT Raipur highlights leadership and teamwork skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Limited Project Scope:** While the projects are good, they are relatively small-scale.  Adding a larger, more complex project (maybe involving a team) would strengthen his application significantly.\n",
      "* **Lack of Frontend Experience:** The resume focuses solely on backend development. Some basic frontend skills (JavaScript, React, Angular, or Vue.js) would broaden his appeal to a wider range of roles.\n",
      "* **Resume Formatting:** The resume's formatting is inconsistent and uses unconventional symbols.  A professionally formatted resume is crucial.\n",
      "* **Missing Deployment Details:**  The resume lacks details on how the APIs were deployed (e.g., using Docker, AWS, Heroku). This is vital for demonstrating practical deployment skills.\n",
      "* **Absence of specific quantitative results:**  The projects mention functionality but lack quantifiable achievements (e.g., \"Improved API response time by X%,\" \"Reduced error rate by Y%\").\n",
      "\n",

      "Azad's resume showcases a promising candidate with excellent coding skills and a solid foundation in backend development. However, addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly by adding a larger, more complex project, showcasing deployment experience and acquiring frontend skills, would significantly enhance his candidacy.  His current skills are suitable for entry-level backend roles, but further development will open up more opportunities.  He needs to make his resume more visually appealing and provide quantifiable results from his projects.\n"
